2. Use **WASD** to move and **SPACE** to go faster

3. Press **CapsLock** (or the down arrow on a dpad) again if you want to go back to the player's camera

* Press **Q** to freeze time when the camera is on

### Things to keep in mind

- There could be some bugs, so please send a [issue](https://github.com/ShoosGun/FreeCamMod/issues/new) about what you found.

- The camera might appear to be going up or down sometimes, that is caused by the rotation of the planets.
